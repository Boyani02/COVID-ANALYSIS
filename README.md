## COVID-19 Global Data Tracker 

This project involves global data on COVID-19 and aims to gain insights into trends related to cases, deaths, vaccinations, and the influence of socioeconomic characteristics. Python and other library visualizations will be employed to find insights to understand contrasts in the amount of impact the pandemic based on countries and time.


### Objectives

* To clean and prepare the COVID-19 open data
* To analyze time series of trends and metrics 
* To contrast pandemic impacts from country to country
* To compare global patterns through charts and maps
* To correlate with economic and health indicators


### Tools & Libraries

* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* pandas, numpy
* matplotlib, seaborn, plotly


### Dataset

The dataset is obtained from **Our World in Data** and contains:

* Case and death counts (daily + cumulative)
* Vaccination counts
* Testing counts
* Population, GDP, and health


### How to Run / View the Project

#### Set up the Environment by installing dependencies on Visual Studio Code
*pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
*Launch the Notebook

#### Jupyter notebook
Open the file named Diseases.ipynb

#### PDF export (presentation format)

### The main takeaways

* Each wave of the pandemic was time and magnitude but they happened at different times across the globe. 

* Vaccinations have been associated with reductions in death rates, but vaccination was not universally distributed.

* CFR was very different across countries, reflecting quality of health care and age demographics of the population.

* GDP per capita and health care infrastructure were generally associated with better outcomes.

### The limits of our analysis

* In many cases the data we used were based on a variety of definitions and that led to a lot of inconsistency between countries.

* In many instances, numbers are imprecise because many countries underreported cases.

* Other factors like age distribution and the capacity of the health care system had a confounding relationship to CFR.

### Considerations for future work

* Investigate relationships between waves and variants, and political action.

* Explore the relationship between economic, mental, and excess mortality data.

* Plan for comprehensive data resources and predictive models for public health planning, development, and investment. 

### Final reflections

Ultimately the work presents and underscores the critical role data analysis will have in responding to global crises. These crises include the need for equity in access to health care resources and cooperation in sharing data. Without those, it will be extremely difficult to respond to any future pandemics.
